# GrOxyP - Go Proxy and VPN Checker

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/BOOMfinity/GrOxyP.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/BOOMfinity/GrOxyP)
[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/boomfinity/groxyp/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/boomfinity/groxyp)

Check if user is behind a VPN or proxy via simple HTTP request.

## Sources

This app is using [X4BNet's list](https://github.com/X4BNet/lists_vpn) of IPs. GrOxyP checks if queried IP is on this
list.

Sources of code are mentioned in the comments.

# Installation and usage

## As a server

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/BOOMfinity/GrOxyP`.
2. Go to directory: `cd GrOxyP/cmd/groxyp`.
3. Build: `go build`.
4. Set environmental variables as in example:

```sh
  GROXYP_DB_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/X4BNet/lists_vpn/main/output/datacenter/ipv4.txt"
  GROXYP_DB_UPDATE_INTERVAL = "4h0m0s"
  GROXYP_PORT = 5656,
  GROXYP_TOKEN = "such_a_token_wow"
  GROXYP_DEBUG = false
```

> [!NOTE]
> Port and token are only needed, when you want to spin up an HTTP server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always refer to [X4BNet's repo](https://github.com/X4BNet/lists_vpn) for more information about IP lists. You might
> want to replace `datacenter` with `vpn` in the example above.

5. Run!

HTTP server will be waiting for requests at default port 5656. Query `ip` endpoint like so:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:5656/ip?q=194.35.232.123&token=such_a_token_wow
{"ip":"194.35.232.123","proxy":true,"rule":"194.35.232.0/22"}
```

Invalid token will cause `401 Unauthorized` messages. Other endpoints will respond with `404` message.

## Programmatically

Use example code below:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	groxyp "github.com/BOOMfinity/GrOxyP/pkg/client"
	"net"
	"time"
)

var ipChecker, _ = groxyp.NewClient(groxyp.Config{
	DatabaseDownloadURL:    groxyp.X4BNetDatacenterIPv4ListURL, // or groxyp.X4BNetVPNIPv4ListURL, or any other with compatible format
	DatabaseUpdateInterval: time.Hour * 8,
})

func main() {
	isFound, network := ipChecker.FindIP(net.ParseIP("8.8.8.8"))
	fmt.Printf("IP found in the list: %v. IP network: %v", isFound, network.String())
}

```
